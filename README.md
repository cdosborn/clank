# Clank

Clank deploys the [Atmosphere](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/atmosphere) infrastructure within a Linux environment to make using OpenStack for on-demanding computing needs easy.

[Atmosphere](http://www.iplantcollaborative.org/ci/atmosphere) is made up of two distinct elements:
- an API: [_Atmosphere_](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/atmosphere)
- and, a user interface: [_Troposphere_](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/troposphere)

Clank is a set of playbooks & roles and is the replacement for [Crushbone](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/crushbone).

======================
Dependencies and Setup
======================

```bash
apt-get install python-virtualenv -y
apt-get install git python-dev libyaml-dev -y
apt-get install libssl-dev libffi-dev -y

git clone https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank.git

virtualenv clank_env
. clank_env/bin/activate
pip install -r clank/requirements.txt
```

=====
Usage
=====

```bash
./clank.py --env_file $VARIABLES_YML_FILE
```

An example of the [`$VARIABLES_YML_FILE`](dist_files/variables.yml.dist) can be found in the [dist_files](dist_files) directory.

###### Skipping Portions of Clank

Clank's install process is separated into three parts: installation of dependencies, atmosphere, troposphere.
To skip over sections of the deployment process, pass in a comma separated list to the `--skip` clank.py argument.

Supported skip tags: `dependencies`, `atmosphere`, `troposphere`

```bash
./clank.py --env_file $VARIABLES_YML_FILE --skip atmosphere # skips over the installation of atmosphere
```

```bash
./clank.py --env_file $VARIABLES_YML_FILE --skip dependencies,troposphere # skips over the installation of dependencies and troposphere
```

You can actually skip over any tag you may find in the roles and playbooks. Ratchet will pass the desired skips to ansible will skip those.

* A bundle cert
* And a organization ssl key

######SSH keys configuration

* A private id_rsa file
* A public id_rsa file

######Atmosphere and Troposphere DB FILES TO BE LOADED (Not required)
* atmosphere.sql
* troposphere.sql

The location of these files *must* be stated in your _completed_ [variables.yml](https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/clank/blob/master/dist_files/variables.yml.dist#L52-L63).
